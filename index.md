## Welcome to Checkpoint 2 of the physical web demo

Congratulations on making it to the second checkpoint. 

### What is the physical web
 
The Physical Web is an approach to allowing users to interact with physical objects and locations without necessarily having to install an app first.

Using Bluetooth Low Energe (BLE) beacons, _The Physical Web_ enables you to see URLs being broadcast by objects in the environment around you. 

You can intereact with Eddystone beacons on your device using Google Chrome or Nearby Notifications.
